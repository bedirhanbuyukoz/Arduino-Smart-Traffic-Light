# Arduino Smart Traffic Light
Our intersection control simulation project involves creating a smart traffic light.
The aim of our project is to produce smart traffic lights and to provide safe passages using ardunio.

Within the scope of the project, between the smart traffic lights and the streets in the safety periot range
providing safer passages.
